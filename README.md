# WellnessApp
# Android Studio Version 2021.1.1

Displays to a user a database of meals and recipes that are categorized by their ingredients, diet, and overall   
nutrition. Allows users to keep track of what ingredients they currently have in their ‘pantry’ and search for recipes  
based on that information. If a recipe contains ingredients that the user does not have, they can add those  
ingredients to a ‘shopping list’ to keep track of. The app also contains functionality for tracking calories consumed  
and exercise done on a specific day
